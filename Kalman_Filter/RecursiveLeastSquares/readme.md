## Recursive Least Squares Implementation in Python

"RecursiveLeastSquares.py" - contains the class that implements the recursive least squares method

"driverCode.py" - Recursive least squares class object defined in "RecursiveLeastSquares.py".

data.png and plots.png - are plots generated by "driverCode.py". These plots visualize the simulation and estimation results.

Figure below shows the convergence of the recursive least squares method for estimating the initial position, initial velocity, and acceleration. This plot is generated by the file "driverCode.py", and this is the file "plots.png"
